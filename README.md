Lua-Package-Manager (LPM) uses 
LuaRtc: https://github.com/samyeyo/rtc | https://www.luart.org/ - used for converting lua to executable files.
LuaRocks: https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks | https://luarocks.org/ - used for package managing in lpm.
Lua: https://github.com/lua/lua | https://www.lua.org/

Please go check out their repositories / websites since they are the reason lpm is even possible.
> contact me on discord 'encodedterabyte" if you want this repository taken down (only if you own one of the said resources)

ps. lpm is written in lua and uses luartc to compile it to an executable. luartc is really cool please check it out!!!
also most of this is just arbitrary and not final. the "luaproject" file that is generated is soon going to me luarocks bindings for creating packages.

Thanks :)
